Consistent Navigation Experience: The GetX controller ensures your selected menu item stays highlighted when navigating between sections, providing users visual feedback about where they are in the app.
Improved User Experience: The added hover effects make the interface more interactive and responsive, helping users navigate more intuitively.
Better State Management: Using GetX for drawer state management integrates well with your overall app architecture, making it easier to expand functionality later.
Clean Architecture: Separating the controller logic from the UI makes your code more maintainable and easier to test.
